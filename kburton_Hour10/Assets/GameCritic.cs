Improving the game questions
Is the game too easy or hard? 
both version of Chaos Ball are too easy. Often the balls find their goals without the player doing anything. 

What would make it easier or Harder?
To increase the challenge, add more buffer/walls around the colored goal or shrink the size of the goal. 

What would give it a wow factor? 
Adding more visual effects when the ball enters the goal. A new skin or theme to emerse the player in the games fantasy. Backgorund music wouldn't hurt either. 

WHat parts of the game is fun? What parts of the game are tedious? 
The idea of the game is fun but lacks much reply value. The chaos ball doesn't really do much to enhance the play experience. The square play zone is boring.
